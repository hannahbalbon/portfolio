        <h4>Ako si <em><strong>Hannah.</em></strong></h4>
          <p>Born and raised for 19 years in the busy streets of Manila, Philippines, I was exposed to a rich and diverse culture paralleled with the harsh realities of life. Those experiences instilled in me the value of altruism and importance of achieving justice for the oppressed. For me, making a difference in the lives of people is more of an imperative than that of making millions.</p>
          <p>I always strive to live a balanced life. Music, staying active and continuously learning play integral roles in my life. <strong>Music - </strong> I equally enjoy listening to a variety of genres as well as singing, playing the guitar, and other instruments. <strong>Staying Active - </strong> I find joy in playing basketball, tennis, table tennis, hiking and snowboarding. <strong>Continuously learning - </strong> I strive to not be complacent in life. That is why, every year, I make it a point to learn new things. This year, it happens to be coding and skiing. How exciting!</p>
